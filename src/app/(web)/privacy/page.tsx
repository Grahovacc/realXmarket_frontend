        <h1 className=" text-3xl font-bold">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>
          1. This privacy policy applies to H&W Investments Limited’s application at
          www.realxmarket.xcavate.io (the “app”). We at H&W Investments Limited take your
          privacy seriously. This policy covers the collection, processing and other use of
          personal data under the Data Protection Act 1998 (“DPA”) and the General Data
          Protection Regulations (“GDPR”).
        </p>

        <p>
          2. For the purpose of the DPA and GDPR we are the data controller and any enquiry
          regarding the collection or processing of your data should be addressed to Alex Ward,
          H&W Investments Limited, 17 College Road, Waltham Cross, Hertfordshire EN8 9LS.
        </p>

        <p>
          3. By using the application, you consent to this policy. We are registered with the
          Information Commissioner’s Office for this purpose.
        </p>

        <p>
          3A. Application-Specific Privacy Practices This section outlines additional privacy
          measures applicable to users of the realXmarket mobile application (the “App”). These
          terms are in addition to and consistent with the general terms set out in this
          policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          3B. Identity Verification and Camera Access To ensure security and compliance with
          anti-fraud and KYC (Know Your Customer) standards, the realXmarket app may request
          access to your device’s camera to perform identity verification.
        </p>

        <ul className="ml-6 flex list-disc flex-col gap-3">
          <li>
            Purpose: Access to your camera is strictly used for real-time facial recognition or
            photo ID capture to confirm your identity before any transaction (such as asset
            purchases, listings, or transfers) can be initiated or completed within the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consent: You will be asked to provide explicit consent before the app accesses your
            camera. If you do not provide consent, you will not be able to proceed with
            identity verification and, consequently, will be restricted from performing
            financial transactions on the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data Handling: Images and verification data are securely encrypted and transmitted
            to a third-party identity verification provider, who processes this data strictly
            for verification purposes. Such providers are contractually bound to comply with
            applicable data protection laws, including GDPR.
          </li>
          <li>
            Retention: Verification data (e.g. photo ID or facial scan) will be retained by the
            third party verification company only for the duration necessary to validate
            identity and comply with relevant legal obligations. After this period, the data is
            securely deleted unless otherwise required by law.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          3C. Security Measures in the App The realXmarket application uses end-to-end
          encryption and secure biometric authentication (where supported) to protect user
          identity and transaction integrity. Access to sensitive features is gated by identity
          checks and/or secure PIN or biometric login.
        </p>

        <h4 className="font-bold"> Information we collect</h4>
        <p>
          4. We will collect personal data on this application only if it is directly provided
          to us by you the user, e.g. your e-mail address, name, home or work address and
          telephone number, and therefore has been provided by you with your consent. Normally
          you will only provide such details if you wish to sign up for our free enewsletter or
          other resources, or are making a purchase from us.
        </p>
        <p>
          5. We also use analytical and statistical tools that monitor details of your visits
          to our application and the resources that you access, including, but not limited to,
          traffic data, location data, weblogs and other communication data (but this data will
          not identify you personally).
        </p>
        <p>
          6. Your payment information (e.g. bank account details) provided when you make a
          purchase from our application is not received or stored by us. That information is
          processed securely and privately by third-party payment processors connected via an
          API. H&W Investments Limited will not have access to that information at any time. We
          may share your personal data with our payment processors, but only for the purpose of
          completing the relevant KYC, KYB & AML checks. Such payment processors are banned
          from using your personal data, except to provide these necessary payment services to
          us, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your personal data and
          payment information.

          enable us to provide our services to you, and to meet our contractual commitments to
          you. In addition, we may use the information for the following purposes: 8.1 To
          notify you about any changes to our application, such as improvements or
          service/product changes, that may affect our service;
        </p>
        <p>
          8.2 If you are an existing customer, we may contact you with information about goods
          and services similar to those that were the subject of a previous sale to you;
        </p>

        <p>
          8.3 Where you have consented to receive such information, to provide information on
          other parties’ products or services that we feel may be of interest to you;
        </p>

        <p>
          8.4 Where you have consented to receive our e-newsletters, from time to time to
          provide that to you.
        </p>

        <h1 className="font-bold">Disclosure of your information</h1>

        <p>
          9. We may disclose your information to regulatory bodies to enable us to comply with
          the law and to assist fraud protection and minimise credit risk.
        </p>

        <p>
          risk. 10. Where you have consented for us to do so, we may provide your data to
          selected third parties who may contact you about their goods or services that you may
          be interested in.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        11. If you do not want us to use your data for our [or third parties’] use, you will
        have the opportunity to withhold your consent to this when you provide your details to
        us on the form on which we collect your data, or you can do so by writing to us at the
        address detailed in clause 2, or sending us an email to help@xcavate.io at any time.
      </p>

      <p>
        12. Please be advised that we do not reveal information about identifiable individuals
        to our advertisers but we may, on occasion, provide them with aggregate statistical
        information about our visitors.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-bold">Controlling the use of your data</h1>

      <p>
        13. If you have given us consent to use your data for a particular purpose you can
        revoke or vary that consent at any time. If you do not want us to use your data or want
        to vary the consent that you have provided you can write to us at the address detailed
        in clause 2 or email us at help@xcavate.io at any time.
      </p>

      <h1 className="font-bold">Where we store and transfer your data</h1>

      <p>
        14. As part of the services offered to you, for example through our Website, the
        information you provide to us may be transferred to and stored in countries outside of
        the European Economic Area (EEA) as we use remote website server hosts to provide the
        website and some aspects of our service, which may be based outside of the EEA, or use
        servers based outside of the EEA – this is generally the nature of data stored in “the
        Cloud”. It may also be processed by staff operating outside the EEA who work for one of
        our suppliers, e.g. our website server host, or work for us when temporarily outside of
        the EEA.
      </p>

      <p>
        15. A transfer of your personal data may happen if any of our servers are located in a
        country outside of the EEA or one of our service providers is located in a country
        outside of the EEA. If we transfer or store your personal data outside the EEA in this
        way, we will take steps with the aim of ensuring that your privacy rights continue to
        be protected, as outlined in this privacy policy and in accordance with the DPA and
        GDPR. If you use our service while you are outside the EEA, your personal data may be
        transferred outside the EEA in order to provide you with these services.
      </p>

      <p>
        16. We do not use or disclose sensitive personal data, such as race, religion, or
        political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
      </p>

      <p>
        17. We may disclose your personal data outside of our group: (a) in the event that we
        sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your personal data to
        the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets; and (b) if H&W Investments
        Limited’s business is bought by a third party, in which case personal data <br />{' '}
        <br />
        held by it about its customers will be one of the assets to transfer to the buyer.
        However, any such transfer will only be on terms that the confidentiality of your
        personal data is protected and that the terms of this privacy policy will continue to
        be complied with by the recipient.
      </p>

      <p>
        18. Otherwise, we will process, disclose or share your personal data only if required
        to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to comply
        with legal requirements or legal process served on us or the website.
      </p>

      <p>
        19. You have the right to opt out of our processing your personal data for marketing
        purposes by contacting us at help@xcavate.io.

        your own risk. Once we have received your personal data, we will use strict procedures
        and security features to try to prevent unauthorised access.
